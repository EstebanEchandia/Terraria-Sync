# Terraria-Sync

Simple powershell script to sync terraria maps between players, so any one can host/play anytime they want.

Instrucctions:

I recommend syncing SinglePlayer Maps to Steam Cloud, you can do this on Terraria Level selection, clicking the cloud, Doing this will prevent SinglePlayer Worlds to be added to the repository.

1- You have to create a github repository on C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds"
 If one of your friends has alredy created the repository, you should clone it in "C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds".

2- Upload your world to this repository.

3- If your terraria game path is different to'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria\Terraria.exe', edit this script with your game path.

4- Run this script everytime you open the world you want to be synced with your friends, they should do this too.

5-After closing terraria, wait for the app to upload your map.

6- Have fun playing!
