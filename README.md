# Terraria-Sync

Simple powershell script to sync terraria maps between players, so any one can host/play anytime they want.
Please backup your maps before running the script for precaution.

Instrucctions:

I recommend syncing SinglePlayer Maps to Steam Cloud, you can do this on Terraria Level selection, clicking the cloud, Doing this will prevent SinglePlayer Worlds to be added to the repository.
In Multiplayer worlds you should see this: ![mp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55214395/82155813-e891e280-984d-11ea-9702-25c25f632271.png)

And on SinglePlayer this: ![sp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55214395/82155854-20992580-984e-11ea-956e-d16a3edb0240.png)


1- You have to create a github repository on C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds"
 If one of your friends has alredy created the repository, you should clone it in "C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds".

2- Upload your world to this repository.

3- If your terraria game path is different to'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria\Terraria.exe', edit this script with your game path (line 66).

4- Run this script everytime you open the world you want to be synced with your friends, they should do this too.

5-After closing terraria, wait for the app to upload your map.

6- Have fun playing!
