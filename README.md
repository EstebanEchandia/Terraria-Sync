# Terraria-Sync
Instrucctions:

I recommend syncing SinglePlayer Maps to Steam Cloud, you can do this on Terraria Level selection, clicking the cloud, Doing this will prevent SinglePlayer Worlds to be added to the repository.
1- You have to create a github repository on C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds"
1.1- If one of your friends has alredy created the repository, you should clone it in C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds

2- Upload your world to this repository

3- Edit this script and change your Terraria.exe location, Default is:'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terraria\Terraria.exe'

4- Run this script everytime you open the world you want to be synced with your friends, they should do this too
